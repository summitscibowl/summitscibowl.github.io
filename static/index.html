                                Bowl program. From personal experience I can attest that they all have a combined level
                                of comprehensive knowledge that spans every subject at every level of difficulty seen in
                                Science Bowl. A class with any of them would be an invaluable experience for a Science
                                Bowl player at any level. Having seen the syllabus for the chemistry class and knowing
                                Bill Zhao, a USNCO study camp qualifier who is the teacher, I can say with confidence
                                that the class will be useful to players of any level wishing to pursue chemistry.

                                confidence that anyone attending their course will leave more motivated and informed
                                than before. Their Biology course is taught by none other than Rohan Shelke, one of the
                                best biology players in Science Bowl.

                                to play against in high school. Every game I played with them was a challenge that I
                                looked forward to, not only due to their depth of knowledge in their respective
                                categories, but also because of their ability to convert that knowledge into points and
                                wins and extremely strong game sense. The Physics course is extremely comprehensive and
                                is taught by Sanjay, who has amply demonstrated his skills, both in Science Bowl and in
                                teaching.</h5>

                                Science Bowl has been fundamentally changed by these four, whose contributions to developing both competitions and practice materials have been exceptional.
                                In particular, Sanjay's dedication to expanding physics resources for enthusiasts of all levels has been multi-dimensional, from writing great questions to insightful handouts on topics like Lagrangian Mechanics that would otherwise be inaccessible to most high schoolers.

                                Having worked alongside Rohan, Bill, Sanjay, and Geoffrey, I am a witness to their hard work when it comes to science bowl, making them some of the most qualified mentors.
                                Their deep understanding of science and their ability to regurgitate it in a comprehensible manner is unmatched by any other individual.
                                Having seen the chemistry class syllabus, it is evident that the mentors have the resources to transform any individual into an expert in their field.
