        <p class="h1 mb-sm-3">Frequently Asked Questions</p>

        <p class="h5 text-warning">What if I want to do more than one subject?</p>
        <p>
            You certainly can!
            However, it is important to note that each course is equally rigorous, and overloading yourself can be detrimental to your progress.
            It is in our best interest that you improve as much as you can.
        </p>

        <p class="h5 text-warning">How much improvement would I expect to make in this course?</p>
        <p>
            The amount of improvement you make will be directly proportional to the amount of time you put in. If a student does not attend lectures and review their notes, it is unlikely that they will improve at all. However, if a student attends all the lectures, reviews the notes, and studies from the supplemental resources, they can expect to make large improvements. The summer course is designed to help students to answer approximately 80-90% of regional questions in their subject. These courses will also help students prepare for both Middle School regionals and nationals.
        </p>
        <p class="h5 text-warning">Are there course discounts?</p>
        <p>
            Yes! Email us for more details at <span class="text-info">summitscibowl@gmail.com</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="h5 text-warning">Can middle schoolers take our classes?</p>
        <p>
            Yes! These classes are suitable for both high school and advanced middle school students above the age of 13.
        </p>
        <p class="h5 text-warning">Will the number of seats in a course ever be raised?</p>
        <p>
            At the moment, we have decided to limit each course to 15 people, so that instructors can give more personalised attention to each student.
            If not one of the first 15 people to sign up, we cannot guarantee you a placement in the course.
            After the priority registration, the Head Instructor for a subject may decide to increase the size of their course, if they feel that they have the resources to support more students.
            Therefore, we encourage students to sign up as soon as possible, in order to reserve a spot.
        </p>
        <p class="h5 text-warning">How will this course be specifically helpful for Science Bowl?</p>
        <p>
            All of our instructors have years of experience in Science Bowl, have written questions for tournaments, and have competed at the national level. We are teaching topics that show up in questions very frequently, and upon completion of a course, we estimate that students will be able to answer 80-90% of questions in their subject at the regional level. Additionally, anyone who signs up for our course will have access to seminars about study tips, buzzing strategies, and teamwork skills. 
        </p>
        <p class="h5 text-warning">
            What topics will be covered in each lesson?
        </p>

            Contact us at <span class="text-info">summitscibowl@gmail.com</span> if you would like to see the syllabus for any course.
        </p>
        <p class="h5 text-warning">
            Are there any other class series that Summit Scibowl offers?
        </p>
        <p>
            As of now, we are only offering the intermediate series. However, we have plans to launch an advanced series in the fall for high school nationals.
